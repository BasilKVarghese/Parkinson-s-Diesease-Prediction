# Predicting Parkinsons UPDRS scores using Parkinsons Telemonitoring Dataset

The Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset is a dataset that comprises of biomedical voice measurments from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Columns in the dataset contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.

This notebook aims to analyze, visualize and determine the important features among these 20 features that can help us predict the two target variables, namely, motor_UPDRS and total_UPDRS.
